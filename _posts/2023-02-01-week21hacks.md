# Intentional or Purposeful Bias 
1. 
    - Tik Tok age group: 16-24
    - Facebook age group: 25-34
    - This data proves that different generations are the target audiences for these different apps. I definitely think that these two different companies aim to reach different age groups by putting more trendy content based on age. For an example, I think that Facebook is for a more mature audience with interests more in the adult life such as politics, communication, and community concerns. Tik Tok reaches the younger demographic by promoting trends, dances, and humor that younger people would be more interested in. 
    - This is great for business because business can choose which app to promote on based off of who their target audience and customers are. 

2.  
    - Virtual assistants may have female voices due to past female gender roles. 
    - I will see promoted videos on Tik Tok that make me want to buy a product or try something new.
