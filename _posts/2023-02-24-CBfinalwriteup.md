# Collegeboard Write up
> Below is my CB write-up for my CPT section of my team's fitness project. 

[I am using these scoring guidelines to organize my write-up.](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap22-sg-computer-science-principles.pdf)

[Here is a link to my video]()

| Row |  Scoring Criteria | Response |
|-----|-------------------|----------|
| 1 |  • describes the overall purpose of the program.
• describes what functionality of the program is
demonstrated in the video.
• describes the input and output of the program
demonstrated in the video.    |      |
| 2 |  includes two program code segments:
- one that shows how data has been stored in
this list (or other collection type).
- one that shows the data in this same list being
used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose.
• identifies the name of the variable representing the
list being used in this response.
• describes what the data contained in this list is
representing in the program.   |      |
| 3 | includes a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program. Responses that do not earn the point in row 2 may still earn the point in this row.
 • explains how the named, selected list manages
complexity in the program code by explaining why
the program code could not be written, or how it
would be written differently, without using this list.   |      |
| 4 | includes two program code segments:
- one showing a student-developed procedure Requirements for program code segments:
with at least one parameter that has an effect
on the functionality of the procedure.
- one showing where the student-developed
procedure is being called.
• describes what the identified procedure does and
how it contributes to the overall functionality of the
program.     |      |
| 5 |  • includes a program code segment of a student-developed algorithm that includes
- sequencing 
- selection
- iteration
• explains in detailed steps how the identified
algorithm works in enough detail that someone else
could recreate it.    |      |
| 6 |  The written response:
Testing • describes two calls to the selected procedure
identified in written response 3c. Each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a different
segment of code in the algorithm to execute.
• describes the condition(s) being tested by each call
to the procedure.
• identifies the result of each call.    |      |
