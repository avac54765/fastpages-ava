# Switching from Minima to Architect

![architect theme]({{site.baseurl}}/images/newthemepage.png)

To swtich my theme, I first replaced the remote theme from "Jekyll/minima" to "pages-themes/architect@v0.2.0".

## Positive Effects of this New Theme


This new theme offered many cool features on my blog.

1. Made the preview images for posts larger drawing more attention.

2. Post formating is cool with blue coloring and font changes.

3. The comments work the same and are fully functional at the bottom of every post.

## Negative Effects of this New Theme

This theme also caused issues with my fastpage.

1. Made my text on my home page very large.

![home text]({{site.baseurl}}/images/largetext.png)



2. User unable to access different pages. This means the user is only able to acess my home page and posts, but is unable to access helpful resources, my about me page, my tags, and loses the ability to search the website.

3. The table formatting changed and is slightly harder to read. It looks less professional in my opinion.

4. The text color on the blue post titles make the text harder to read.
