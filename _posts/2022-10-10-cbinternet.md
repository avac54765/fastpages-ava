- <mark>A computer network</mark> is a group of interconnected computig devices capable of sending or recieving data
- A computer network is a type of computing system
- A <mark>path</mark> between two computing devices on a computer network (a sender and a reciever) is a <mark>sequence of directly connected computing devices</mark> that begins at the sender and ends at the receiver
- <mark>the bandwidth</mark> of a computer network is the **maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time**
- Bandwidth is usually measured in <mark>bits per second</mark>
-<mark>A packet</mark>= a small amount of data sent over a network. Each packet also includes the source and the destination information (for sending and receiving data)
-<mark>route</mark>= the process of finding a path from sender to receiver


# Video Two Notes
- The internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use <mark>standardized, open (nonproprietary) communication protocals</mark>
- Access to the internet depends on the ability to connect a computing device to an Internet connected device
- <mark>A protocal</mark>= an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system
- the protocals used in the Internet are <mark>open,</mark> which allows users to easily connect additional computing devices to the Internet
- Routing on the Internet is usually <mark>dynamic</mark>; it is not specified in advance

I accidentally took this quiz before watching the videos so I had no bacakground information on this. I think I would do better now.

I struggled with the quiz because of the wording. After reading the questions again in my results, I realized my dumb mistakes. I need to read the questions more carefully next time.
