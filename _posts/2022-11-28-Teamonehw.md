# Hacks 1 1.1(Data Types and Variables)

# Hacks 2 3.1.2(Variables)


1. An assignment operator, like the "=" in python, assigns a value to a variable. Assignment operators can assign strings, integers, and booleans to variables. This allows for a user to use the variables in various functions.

2. In Colledgeboard pseudocode, the symbol "<--" is the assignment operator (assigns values to variables).

3. The print command will print the latest value of a variable. Due to the value of x being changed to 22, the command will display 22, not 15.


# Hacks 3 3.2.1 (List and Strings using Variables)

1. A list is a finite series of ordered values.
2. An element is a value within a list.
3. An easy way to reference the elements in a list or string is by indexing. You can use the print function to print a specific element in a list.
4. An example of a string is "apple".

Below is my list that I created of my favorite foods.
Additionally, I created a dictonary of lists and indexed the elements within these lists as well.

Below is my simplified list:

**Question:**
Using lists are better for a program, rather than writing out each line of code, because lists manage complexity within a program. It is much easier and saves a lot of time to organize values in a list. Lists also make it easier for other programers to understand a program instead of tracking numerous variables. Writing out each line of code takes a lot of time as well, and can get very tiring as you add more values to a program.
