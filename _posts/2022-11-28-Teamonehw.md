# Hacks 2 (Variables)


1. An assignment operator, like the "=" in python, assigns a value to a variable. Assignment operators can assign strings, integers, and booleans to variables. This allows for a user to use the variables in various functions.

2. In Colledgeboard pseudocode, the symbol "<--" is the assignment operator (assigns values to variables).

3. The print command will print the latest value of a variable. Due to the value of x being changed to 22, the command will display 22, not 15.


# Hacks 3

1. A list is a finite series of ordered values.
2. An element is a value within a list.
3. An easy way to reference the elements in a list or string is by indexing. You can use the print function to print a specific element in a list.
4. An example of a string is "apple".

Below is my list that I created of my favorite foods.
Additionally, I created a dictonary of lists and indexed the elements within these lists as well.
