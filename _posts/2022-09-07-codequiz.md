## The Design Process

1. ### Picking a theme
    I first picked out a theme I was interested in to create my quiz. I chose Spiderman as my theme.
2. ### Writing my Questions
    My three questions on my app will be: **How many Spidermans are there in the cinematic universe?**, **Who is the best Spiderman?**, and **Which Spiderman said "I love you" to the other Spidermans in the Spiderman movie, *No Way Home*?**
3. ### Designing my Quiz.
    I decided that there will be a home page with an image of Tom Holland as spiderman. When you click a "start" button, the app will direct you to the first question and page. When you answer it will then direct you to the next question and so on. At the very end, the quiz will have four pages: a 100% success page, a 66% success page, a 33% success page, and a 0% success page. The user will be directed to whatever page they scored on the quiz.
