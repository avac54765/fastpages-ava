## Live Review 3 Vocabulary and Examples

- **Binary Numbers**: a numbering scheme in which there are only two possible values for each digit -- 0 or 1 -- and is the basis for all binary code used in computing systems
- **Hexadecimal**: a numbering system with base 16

- **Bits**: the smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store
    - ex: 1 or 0 (one number in binary is a bit)
- **Bytes**: a unit of data that is eight binary digits long
    - ex: 10010110
- **Nibble**: four consecutive binary digits or half of an 8-bit byte
    - ex: 0101

- **Unsigned Integer**: integers but have the property that they don't have a + or - sign associated with them
    - ex: 2, 3, 6, 1000
- **Signed Integer**: integers that have a + or - sign associated with them
    - ex: -2, +3,000, -1
- **Floating Point**: a positive or negative whole number with a decimal point
    - ex: 3.25, 5.1, 67.627
- **Binary Data Abstractions**:
- **Boolean**: a logical data type that can have only the values true or false

- **ASCII**: (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) a standard code for characters stored in a computer or to be transmitted between computers
- **Unicode**: a universal character encoding standard
- **RGB**: a system for representing the colors to be used on a computer display

- **Data Compression**: a reduction in the number of bits needed to represent data
    - **Lossy**: data encoding and compression technique that deliberately discards some data in the compression process
    - **Lossless**: restores and rebuilds file data in its original form after the file is decompressed

## Live Review 2 Vocabulary and Examples

- **variables**: "containers" or used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program
- **data types**:  a classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be applied to it
- **assignment operators**: the operator used to assign a new value to a variable
- **lists**: an abstract data type that represents a finite number of ordered values
- **dictionaries**: an abstract data type that defines an unordered collection of data as a set of key-value pairs
- **class**:  a template definition of a method and variable in a particular kind of object
- **algorithm**: a procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation
- **sequence**: the order of how to do something to achieve a result
- **selection**: allows an algorithm to make a decision based on if a condition is met
- **iteration**: iteration: a loop and doing something again until a condition is met
- **expressions**: a concept in which a number of variables or constants, and operators and functions, are put together in a single statement that is acted on by a particular programming language
- **comparison operators**: compare the values within an expression, such as to check if the value held by a variable matches the value held by another variable
- **boolean expression**: a logical statement that is either TRUE or FALSE
- **truth tables**: a breakdown of all the possible truth values returned by a logical expression (usually 1/0, true/false)
- **characters**: a display unit of information equivalent to one alphabetic letter or symbol
- **strings**: an array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements
- **length**: length() function returns the number of items in an object
- **concatenation**: the operation of joining two strings together
- **python if**: a conditional statement tha decides if a certian condition is true/decides whether certain statements need to be executed or not
- **python elif**: elif = else if and checks for multiple expressions (if the condition for if is False, it checks the condition of the next elif block)
- **python else conditionals**: else catches anything which isn't caught by the previous conditions (like and if statement)
- **nested selection statements**: when more than one decision must be made before carrying out a task
- **Python for loop**: a control flow statement that is used to repeatedly execute a group of statements as long as the condition is satisfied
- **Python while loop with range and with list**:  sets aside a block of code that is to be executed repeatedly until a condition is falsified
- **Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue**:
- **Procedural Abstraction**: when we create code sections which are generalised by having variable parameters (more simple)
- **Python Def procedures**:
- **paramerters**: a special kind of variable used in a function to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the function
- **return values**: a value that a function returns to the calling function when it completes its task
