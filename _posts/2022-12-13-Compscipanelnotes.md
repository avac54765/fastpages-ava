## Questions


### Most Important skill to have in the tech industry?
KRIS:
- Continuous Learning
- Learn multiple programming languages
- “Learn how to learn” = always be ready to learn more

- Don’t be super concerned about things you read on the news (resiliance)
The only risk is not learning
 
KATHYLEEN:
- Be adaptive
- Career paths won’t always be a straight line
- Best technicians: listen and solve technical requirements (can explain in non-technical terms)

### Something they had to Learn:
- To be adaptive 
- Be able to pass code tests (code has to work)

### Work/life balance:
- Some companies are great with work hours 
- Some have a lot of hours/deadlines
- If you have outside hobbies/necessities = set boundaries

## Takeaways:

1. Don't give up with computer science and programming, it's difficult and takes time!
2. Try many different things and fields including exploring the more product side of management (collaborating with coders).
3. Always be willing to learn more! Especially in the field of tech, technology is always changing. I need to be open to continuous learning and know that I will never know everything.
