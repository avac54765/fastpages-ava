# 1.2 Program Function and Purpose
- Computing Innovations:
    - **Applications**= games, social media, business, productivity
    - **Physical Devices**= computers, smart phones, smart "things", and wearables
    - **Systems**= E-commerce, cloud services, e-mail
-  Questions to ask:
    - Why does the computing innovation exist?
    - What problem(s) does the computing innovation solve?
    - What does the computing innovation allow us to do that we would not do before?
- Identifying Inputs to Programs:
    - Computer Programs accept input in a variety of different forms:
        -tactile (touch)
        -audio
        -visual
        -text (incuding numerical values)
- How do programs recieve input?
    - most programs are written in an event driven environment
       - "events" are triggered by some action, which usually sends input to the program (mouse clciks, screen taps/swipes, physical button clicks, keyboard entries, audio trigger)
- input usually affects the output
    - What are outputs produced by a device?= visual, audio, tactile, text
    - what sort of output do your devices supply?= smart phone, laptop computer, gaming console
- an action triggers an event:
    - action may be initialized by the user or another program/device
    - the program "jumps" to the code segement according to the event: the code segment is executed, output is triggered by the code segement
    - the program code is not necessarily executed "in order": code segements are executed as they are called, according to evetns triggered
    - What is a program?= a collection of statements, a group of statements= **code segment**, executed according to the rules of the programming language (software)
- description:
    - simply state what it does (so someone could use the segment in larger program)
    - how it does what it dows (explain in detail the code)

# 1.3 Program Design and Development
- Developers decide on the program requirements that: describe how a program should behave, include list of user interactions, specifications outline of all requirements
- How is a program developed?
    - program developmet is rarely a solo endeavor
    - usually developed by teams of people
    - individuals/teams wrk on different functional components
    - each member of the project deserves to recieves credit for their work
    - their names must be written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project
    - Giving credit: use comments, assign who fixes a problem, include author's name and the source of any code segments being used

# Difficulties 
- I need to study the different functions and get used to identifying what is occuring in code.
