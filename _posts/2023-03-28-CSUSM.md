- scholarship= privately funded money for students
- how to look for a scholarship= look for yourself, you can get one for almost anything
- grant= determined greatly on parent income
- declare independent once 18 so you can get more funding opportunities (not going off parent income)

# Reflection

- A similar theme to past events like this is the theme of never giving up. If you are interested in a subject and you are not doing very well in it, KEEP GOING.
- Don't be afraid to try something new. CSUSM is a smaller school and supports switching pathways.
- Research for grants and scholarships beforehand! Try to avoid taking loans so you don't have student debt.
- You can get paid for summer programs and for graduate school (depending on what field you go into)
- Don't be afraid to fail! Try for opportunities that you think you won't get cause you'll never know what will happen.
