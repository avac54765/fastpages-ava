# Learning to Collaborate
Goals: 
- Explain how computing innovations are improved through collaboration.
- Demonstrate effective interpersonal skills during collaboration.


### Unit 1.1 Collegeboard Collaboration Video Notes
- Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it.

- A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function.
- A computing innovation can be physical (self-driving car), nonphysical computing software (picture editing software), or a nonpyuhiscal computing concept (e-commerce).

- Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias in the development of computing innovations.

Interpersonal Skills Learned:
- Effective collaboration helps with communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, and negociation skills.
