# Learning to Collaborate
Goals: 
- Explain how computing innovations are improved through collaboration.
- Demonstrate effective interpersonal skills during collaboration.
- Explain how computing innovations are improved through collaboration.
- Explain hoe computing innovations are developed by groups of people.


### Unit 1.1 Collegeboard Collaboration Video Notes
- Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it.

- A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function.

- A computing innovation can be physical (self-driving car), nonphysical computing software (picture editing software), or a nonpyuhiscal computing concept (e-commerce).

- Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias in the development of computing innovations.

Interpersonal Skills Learned:
- Effective collaboration helps with communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, and negociation skills.

### Unit 1.1 Video Two Notes
- Consultaton and communication with users are important aspects of the development of computing innovations. 
- Information gathered from potential users can be used to understand the purpose of a program from diverse perspectives and to develop a program that fully incorporates these perspectives.
- Online tools support collaboration by allowing programmers to share and provide feedback on ideas and documents.
- Common models such as pair programming exist to facilitate collaboration.
- **pair programming**= two programmers work together as a pair- one writes the code (driver) while the other reviews each line as being typed in (navigator)
- **Think-Pair-Share**= students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class
- **helpful idea**= leave comments in code!
