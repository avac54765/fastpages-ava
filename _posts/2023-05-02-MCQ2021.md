# My Overall Score

<img width="554" alt="score" src="https://github.com/avac54765/avaflaskproject/assets/111486111/a4c84ae5-427e-442a-a469-a44d87c235d2">

I feel very proud of this score (68/70) since I did not check with Alexa this time and I used very little resources (ngl I did Google a couple of vocabulary terms because I was curious and wanted to know them for the AP test). If I did not Google a couple of vocabulary terms (like analog audio signal and keylogging), I likely would have gotten a 65/70 instead of 68/70.



# Incorrect Questions

### Question 14: Error in Increasing procedure
<img width="769" alt="q14" src="https://github.com/avac54765/avaflaskproject/assets/111486111/97d57f1e-dbcf-4a54-b6fc-3704ccfba9a5">

On this question, I only thought about how I need to change the > sign so that the sign would match the problem in which it would result in true (when the lower number is lower for the whole list it should display true). Therefore I did not think about how you would only want to return if it is false because the program terminates and finishes once it returns true or false. This is why I should have switched the true and false so that the whole list is checked unless an error in the list is found.


### Question 50: Use of symmetric encryption
<img width="777" alt="q50" src="https://github.com/avac54765/avaflaskproject/assets/111486111/0b8e253c-b553-4c80-b3be-0e73b05676a1">

On this question, I was unaware that there are two different types of encryption: public key encryption and symmetric encryption. I thought both types of encryption required two different keys: one public and one private, but that is only for public. Public is what we used when creating our Fastpages and is the more secure option. Symmetric encryption uses a single key. Public key encryption uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.


# Advice for next time:

On the AP test I just need to check my answers by plugging in multiple situations into procedures to make sure they or my answers work. I also need to study more vocabulary that I did not know for the AP test. Here are the topics I need to study:


- analog audio signal
- Creative Commons license (licenses)
- devices and information can be susceptible to unauthorized access if weak passwords are used?
- a seven-digit negative number as its count, while the counts for the other videos displayed correctly. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the error? number 21
- A binary number is to be transformed by appending three 0s to the end of the number. For example, 11101 is transformed to 11101000. Which of the following correctly describes the relationship between the transformed number and the original number? numer 31
- Which of the following is a true statement about the use of public key encryption in transmitting messages? number 32
-  heuristic approach number 33
- Question
Individuals sometimes attempt to remove personal information from the Internet. Which of the following is the LEAST likely reason the personal information is hard to remove? 36
- Which of the following best exemplifies the use of keylogging to gain unauthorized access to a computer system? 43
- Which of the following is an example of an attack using a rogue access point? 48
- Which of the following best explains how symmetric encryption algorithms are typically used? 50
- binary search equation: log base 2(n) +1
