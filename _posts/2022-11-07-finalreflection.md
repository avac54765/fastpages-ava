# Colledgeboard Final

### Reflection

![Final Score]({{site.baseurl}}/images/final.png)

On this final I received a **48/50** (to my surprise). I believe the reason for my success was working with others that were also taking the test (hearing their reasoning) and actually taking my time when reading and answering the questions. 

One thing that helped me greatly with the more logic-based qustions was taking a screenshot of a question and using the sketch tool on my laptop to **sketch out my work**. On the AP test, I will hopefully use a <mark>scratch piece of paper</mark> to write out my math and logic to I don't mess it up. 

Watching the <mark>colledgeboard videos</mark> greatly helped me understand the content on this test. After the test though, I went back and watched all the videos from <mark>Big Idea 2 </mark> about binary numbers, data compression, extracting information from data, and using programs with data because those questions were especially challenging for me. 

### Corrections

I got two questions wrong on this final test:

- Q11 How nested loops with lists function:
    - ![Q11]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q11.png)
    - I selected "A", but the correct answer was "B"
    - I thought that this list compares each element to all other elements in the list to check for duplicates, but it only checks the elements that follow it. 
    - the inner loop iterated form index j + 1 to the end of the list, meaning it doesn't check previous elements as well.

- Q36 Store even numbers in evenList
    -  ![Q36]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q36.png)
    - I selected "C", but the correct answer was "D"
    - I was thinking that "i" needed one to be added to it to make the first term of the list 2, which is the first even number. Although, the purpose of the i + 1 is to get the next term of the list, not to make it initally even.
    - "i" needed to be multiplied by 2 first, and then add one to i so that 2 can be multiplied by 2, the next term in the list.


 # Night at the Museum

Night at the Museum was a night where all of the computer science students were able to display their projects for others to see and learn from. I learned a great deal from the night even though ours didn't go that well. 

 ### What went Wrong
 - Alexa and I had practice that night right after the first time slot, so we had little time to actually explore the other projects. 
 - our project crashed the day of the night at the museum about an hour before due to an error in the backend code
 - The team was unaware of this error, causing a panic at the night at the museum because our AWS, and therefore APIs, were not working.
 - We were unable to fix the issue before Alexa and I had to leave, meaning we were unable to show our project to other parents and students.

 ### Tips for Next Time
 - In the future our team needs to have all code finished a few days before in case we need to spend a few days on the debugging process.
 - make sure team members alert each other when critical changes are made
 - try to have a free night for Night at the Museum to walk around and appreciate other peoples' projects and art. 


 ### Other People's Projects
- I loved being able to see other people's projects for this class, and especially APCSA
- the APCSA students were able to make their projects look very professional. I even had to ask one group what they used for frontend thinking they used some other fancy site, but they used fastapges. It really opened my eyes with design and creativity capabilities instead of simple fastpage templates. I think I need to learn more about the CSS page in order to make these cool edits.
- One group I loved in my class of APCSP was the Frost group. This group is more on the advanced side and was able to successfully create a minesweepers game. I thought it was awesome seeing them create this advanced game from scratch. I saw them plan their project and saw their final project at Night at the Museum.
