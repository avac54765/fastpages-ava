# My Overall Score

![Exam Score]({{site.baseurl}}/images/examscore.png)

I received a 65/66 on the test. 

Without the help of researching or comparing answers with Alexa, I realistically would have gotten a 60/66 on this exam either due to me not knowing a couple of conceptual questions and/or logic errors. Although, I did complete this exam within the two hour limit (with getting distracted at times) that the AP exam would require. I know the actual exam would have 4 more questions but I feel that I will be okay on the exam date. These tests are getting easier as I take them and I am getting more efficient at limiting down options for answers and answering more quickly. 


# Incorrect Questions

### Question 14- Comparing Loop Algorithms
![Q14]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q14.png)

I got this question incorrect because I failed to think about when the check before the loop is being made. I figured since Program B has the i + 1 first that it would reach the i > 10 limit faster, but instead it just displays 11 (makes the check for 10, then displays 11). Therefore both algorithms display 10 values, just different values. 


# Questions I had to research and/or talk to Alexa about

### Question 6- Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
![Q6]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q6.png)

To be honest, I had no idea what the Internet Engineering Task Force was even though it sounds familiar to me. I had to research this question but now I feel confident that I would recognize this group and know that they are in charge of internet standards and protocols.

### Question 47-Encrypting and decrypting using public key cryptography
![Q47]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q47.png)

I am unfamiliar with public key cryptography even though I literally generate a public and private key for every fastpage I make. To my understanding now, you must use corresponding public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt messages (ex. recipient public key encrypts = recipient secret key decrypts).

### Question 60- Managing Complexity with Abstraction
![Q60]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q60.png)

This question confused me because I felt that C should have been included in the answers (but A and D were better options). I guess that abstraction refers to simplifying code that is repetitive instead of just simplifying code in general.


# Advice for next time:

I think I am at the point where I just need to make sure I know all of the collegboard topics before the AP exam for I am getting better at the more logical and code analysis questions. Additionally, I just need to test numbers in certain algorithms to prove my answers correct if/when I have extra time on the AP exam.
