# My Experience

This trimester's N@TM went a LOT more smoothly than last trimester's for my group. This time, my group was able to have a successful website with multiple features to present to visitors walking around. Last trimester, my group's entire website crashed due to a last minute change before the event. 

### What went well: 
- successful features to present
- entire group showed up
- able to explain how features worked

Improvements for next time:
- find a more open area to present so all group members can be around the laptop
- try to have a more finalized product by N@TM (ex. have Nikhil's login connect already and make sure all members are caught up)


# APCSP Projects 

### A Fitness Tracking Site
![Etrack site]({{site.baseurl}}/images/etracksite.jpg)

This project has a very similar purpose to our site, but has different functionality. This group has a fitness tracker (similar to us), a calender, a goals section, stats section, and a forum. I love the idea of a forum where users can all share their ideas and experiences. This is definitely a more interactive feature for their site. In the future maybe my group can consider having a live feed where users can communicate or a progress bar.

![Car site]({{site.baseurl}}/images/carsite.jpg)

This website provides a place for users to research and find a car to purchase. Users can input specific features that they would like to have in their car and the site will output all of the cars in their database that have those features. In the future, this group will also have a car wishlist where users can favorite cars for a later time. I really like how this website can narrow down to a user's specific needs. Maybe my group can attempt to do something like this for workouts, such as narrowing down different workouts by type, difficulty, or end goal.

![Arcade Site]({{site.baseurl}}/images/gamesite.jpg)

This website seemed like every kid's dream website when they are bored. This website features two different games at the moment (I think the goal is four). There is a login for user scores to be stored so they don't lose their progress. I like how this website counts scores so users feel like they aren't wasting their time playing these games. These games are very interactive for users and users can switch games when they want to try something new. My group could try adding a score/goal counter to keep track of users' progress.



# Ceramics

This is my friend Grant's work. When it comes to ceramics, he is very detailed in what he does and takes his time. I love looking at his attention to detail and cleanliness in his different projects. 

![Jeremiah Work]({{site.baseurl}}/images/mimiwork.jpg)

This is my friend Jeremiah's work. What caught my eye with Jeremiah's work was his ability to work big without the clay drying out on him. If you look at his giant teapot, he was able to work this large without it cracking which is very impressive. 

![Student Work]({{site.baseurl}}/images/cleanwork.jpg)

This is a random student's work that caught my eye. My friends and I all agreed that this student was incredible at the small details and cleanliness when it comes to sculpting, especially with their teapot. It looks like their projects are machine-made.
