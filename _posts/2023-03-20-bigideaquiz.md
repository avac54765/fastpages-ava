# Quiz Score

![Big Idea Quiz 2 Score]({{site.baseurl}}/images/bigidea2.PNG)

YOOO I scored a 25/25, which is kind of insane to me. This quiz was actually on the easier side, although some of the questions definitely took me some time to think about due to more of this quiz being conceptual questions and asking about certain programs and how to get a certain result. Below are some of the questions that challenged me:


## Binary

![Q1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q25.PNG)

This question asked me about bits, and bits can be confusing to me for some reason. I ended up getting the correct answer, but I had to think more about this question than some of the other ones. When needing to store between 75 and 100 items, I needed to think about what power would make 2, 100 or greater. 2^7 is 128. 


![Q24]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q24new.PNG)

The question above was the first time I had encountered a binary question where I needed to just add one to the binary number. I know that it is not as easy to just add one to binary, because you need to calculate what the current number is, and then add one, and then rewrite that number in binary again. I figured this out, but I didn't like how much I had to think for this one (and kind of guessed).


![Q25]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q25new.PNG)

The question above asked how much greater the transformed binary number is when adding three zeroes. This one I answered correctly by guessing that you are moving the binary over 3 places, so you are multiplying it by 2^3, which is 8 (adding one zero multiplies by 2).

## Booleans

Normally I feel like I can understand truth tables and boolean expressions, although when I have to think about these in terms of situations with tables, data, and intended results, I get confused very easily.

![Q16]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q16.PNG)

This question needed all three conditions to be met, so the AND operator is used between them all.
