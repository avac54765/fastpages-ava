# 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns

- Software companies make money by getting patents for their code and selling them to hardware companies (paying a royalty payment).
- “Black Duck® = helps teams manage the security, quality, and license compliance risks that come from the use of open source and third-party code in applications and containers.” 

## License Types

- Creative Commons Zero = waives compyright interest in a work created and dedicates it to the world-wide public domain
- Open source MIT License = the author of software with MIT License want credit (ex. adding author name in comments)
- Open Source GPL License = lets people do almost anything they want with your project, except distributing closed source versions (can't sell it)
^ Companies will split code to sell the closed patented code and give the open code to customers to piece back together

## Legal and Ethically

- we often violate Digital Rights Management = downloading music, movies, and other content from illegal websites that have bybassed the systems
- creative commons = open source code that lets us learn a lot for free

# Reflection

1. Github License Types when creating a repository: 
    ![Github licenses]({{site.baseurl}}/images/licenses.png)

    - I see many public and universal licenses. These licenses are likely open source code that anyone can access such as the MIT license that just requires credit.
    - I see a "new" and "revised" license that likely lets someone update a patent.
    - There is a Boost Software License that may be a closed source license but I am not sure. 
    -  I assume all of these licenses offered by Github are for making your work public, just requiring some sort of credit when used (maybe different levels of open).

2. There are many different licenses you can get for your code depending on your team's goal. There are open source and closed source code that allow you to share/access code for free or you can sell your code for royalty pay. I think patents are great for giving credit to those who invented/created content/code/program. Look at notes above for more information/summaries.

3. Creating Licenses for repos:

- personal: ![personal license]({{site.baseurl}}/images/fastpagelicense.png)
- team fastpage repo: ![Team fastpage license]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Fitness4Baddieslicense.jpg)
- team flask repo: ![Team flask license]({{site.baseurl}}/images/teamflasklicense.png)
