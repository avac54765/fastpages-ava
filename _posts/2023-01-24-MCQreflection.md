![MCQ Test Score]({{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQtest2.png)

I received a 46/50 on the test, which is a 92%. I would say I was confident with this test, although my team members and I helped each other out. I also had to research about hexadecimal (base 16 not 2) and logic gates. This means I may not have scored as high if this were the actual AP test without the ability to research/talk.

This test was definitely easier than last trimesters when it comes to answering the questions with understanding. I didn't need to research the answers as often as I did first trimester.


# Corrections

### Question 13
![Q13]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q13.png)

On this question, I just missed the equal sign on number one. I put the answer as one and two, but the correct answer was two and three. Looking back at this, I made a dumb mistake. The reason number one doesn't work is because the expression evaluates if the person is less than or EQUAL to 18 years of age, but the person cannot be 18. Number three works because if the person is NOT less than 16, then they are 16 years old or older.


### Question 22
![Q22]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q22.png)

On this question, I thought that only the second algorithm calculates the correct average because it is conducted in a way that I imagine the average being taken. I misunderstood the wording of the first algorithm. Now I understand that the heights of the students are being added, not just writing the new height and erasing the last one. In the end, the heights are all added up and divided by the number of students, correctly calculating the average every time. 


### Question 24
![Q24]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q24.png)

I had originally answered this question correctly, but my team and I decided to change our answers. I think we got confused by how many times the program would repeat. Since the inside is happening "y" amount of times, it makes sense that since that when that is repeated 3 times, it repeats a total of 3y times. Next time when I get a question like this, I will test an integer in for y to see if my answer is correct.



### Question 30

![Q30]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q30pt2.png)

I had also correctly answered this question at first, but decided to change my mind due to the confusion with how the circles are drawn. I wasn't sure if the circle is drawn from the center point or from the bottom point of the circle. It turns out that when 1 is added to y, the center point is moved up and is drawn from that point. If the circle was drawn from the bottom, then answer A would have worked. When subtracting from x and y, you need to draw the circle first but when adding to x and y, you need to draw after.




# Advice for next time:

I need to take more time when answering these questions and testing integers in for these algorithms when I can. Many of these other questions required me to visualize the answer and the process for getting to that answer. I think that if I apply this strategy to all of the questions, I can prevent many of my dumb mistakes.
