![MCQ Test Score]({{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQtest2.png)

I received a 46/50 on the test, which is a 92%. I would say I was confident with this test, although my team members and I helped each other out. I also had to research about hexadecimal (base 16 not 2) and logic gates. This means I may not have scored as high if this were the actual AP test without the ability to research/talk.
