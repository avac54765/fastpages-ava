# Week One

## Collegeboard Grading Methods
> Collegeboard uses this [rubric](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap22-sg-computer-science-principles.pdf) to grade. Read the guidelines in order to plan your project and/or grade other projects.


## Submission Number One

My Score: 5/6

### Reflection

Why Did a Section(s) Not Recieve Points?
- I scored the Program Purpose and Function Row a 0/1 due to the description of the program's purpose. The description of the purpose seemed to describe what the program does more than why a user would use the program. I think the purpose should involve the user's needs for needing the program like helping a user efficiently find information about triangles.
    - Collegeboard also scored this section a 0/1. They wrote: The response does not specify the program’s purpose. Instead, it describes the function of the program, “to provide information about a triangle based on inputted side lengths.” The response does not meet this criteria.
- Collegeboard also scored the section, Managing Complexity, a 0/1 due to meeting none of the criteria. They said that the list was not necessary for the program, and does not manage complexity. They also said that they inaccurately described a different way to not use lists.
    - I graded this section a 1/1 because I thought putting all of the classifications in one place was managing complexity. Additionally, I figured that their explanation of deleting the list fit the rubric.

### Reflection

Why Did a Section(s) Not Recieve Points?
- I decided to score the section, Algorithim Implementation, a 0/1 because I thought they did not explain how they program code worked enough for someone to recreate it. I believe that I thought this due to my lack of experience of coding. As someone who hasn't coded very many projects yet, I would need more detailed instructions than a person grading for Collegeboard.
    - Collegeboard graded this project a 6/6. I was surprised to see this score becauase I feel like Collegeboard grades on the scrict side. It seems that this group explained with excess on how to recreate this project. They described, "“The algorithm uses nested if-else statements to identify which list will be copied from, by looking at the first parameter. Inside the if statement matching that parameter, are another set of if statements to determine where the list should be copied over to. This could be adapted to any number of lists, but is in this case just three, meaning two if statements within each of three nested if-else, as of course a list cannot be copied to itself.” This seems complicated to me so maybe I just didn't understand it enough to recreate it.

### Reflection

- I was very surprised to see the score for this project. I scored this project much higher than collegeboard did. This is because this project often only met one of two requirements for a row, resulting in a zero for that section. This makes me realize how easy it is to lose a point for a section by not meeting all the requirements. 
- What was different?
    - I scored rows one and five as 0/1, unlike collegeboard, who scored rows 1-5 zeroes. I belive this is because I was more leient on the requirements than they were. 
    - When looking at the code segements, I didn't think to look at the list names and check that they list names matched when being implemented. Apparently, this group showed a list being defined in one code segment, but then used a different list being implemented in the code. 
    - Looking at their code segments, I figured that the code looked simple due to managing complexity, but collegboard said that their code was simple to begin with, with little complexity managing.
