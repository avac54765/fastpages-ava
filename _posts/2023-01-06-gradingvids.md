### Reflection

Why Did a Section(s) Not Recieve Points?
- I scored the Program Purpose and Function Row a 0/1 due to the description of the program's purpose. The description of the purpose seemed to describe what the program does more than why a user would use the program. I think the purpose should involve the user's needs for needing the program like helping a user efficiently find information about triangles.
    - Collegeboard also scored this section a 0/1. They wrote: The response does not specify the program’s purpose. Instead, it describes the function of the program, “to provide information about a triangle based on inputted side lengths.” The response does not meet this criteria.
- Collegeboard also scored the section, Managing Complexity, a 0/1 due to meeting none of the criteria. They said that the list was not necessary for the program, and does not manage complexity. They also said that they inaccurately described a different way to not use lists.
    - I graded this section a 1/1 because I thought putting all of the classifications in one place was managing complexity. Additionally, I figured that their explanation of deleting the list fit the rubric.
