# Week 21

## Backend

This week I worked to add a new class to our database for the data from my inspiration page. I was able to successfully create a new table in the SQlite table titled "inspo".

### Backend Goals

Plans for this next week (week 22):
- help team members debug their new classes in the user database 
- get postman working again ^

## Frontend

This week I started to add a table that is capable of creating rows for every new quote. This table also includes the start for CRUD in which users will be able edit and delete their responses. Due to our backend having difficulties with other members adding classes and debugging, I have not been able to fully test this, for only the top row of the table is showing up.

### Frontend Goals

Plans for this next week (week 22):
- get rows in the frontend to work without the backend data (tester data)
- try and get backend to connect to frontend
- try and get frontend to then connect to backend (hopefully back to front already works by then)
