I can use this to answer questions on my AP test related to assigning variables in complex algorithims.\n",

    "1. An assignment operator, like the \"=\" in python, assigns a value to a variable. Assignment operators can assign strings, integers, and booleans to variables. This allows for a user to use the variables in various functions.\n",

    "2. In Colledgeboard pseudocode, the symbol \"<--\" is the assignment operator (assigns values to variables).\n",

I also did not know what an element was but now I know that it is a value within a list. I also learned that indexing is an easy way to access elements in a list. This is very helpful for collegeboard because the AP test has many questions about indexing.\n",
