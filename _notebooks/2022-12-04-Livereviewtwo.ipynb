    "- **iteration**: iteration: a loop and doing something again until a condition is met\n",
    "- **expressions**: a concept in which a number of variables or constants, and operators and functions, are put together in a single statement that is acted on by a particular programming language\n",
    "- **comparison operators**: compare the values within an expression, such as to check if the value held by a variable matches the value held by another variable\n",
    "- **boolean expression**: a logical statement that is either TRUE or FALSE\n",

    "- **python if**: a conditional statement tha decides if a certian condition is true/decides whether certain statements need to be executed or not\n",
    "- **python elif**: elif = else if and checks for multiple expressions (if the condition for if is False, it checks the condition of the next elif block)\n",

    "- **nested selection statements**: when more than one decision must be made before carrying out a task\n",
    "- **Python for loop**: a control flow statement that is used to repeatedly execute a group of statements as long as the condition is satisfied\n",
