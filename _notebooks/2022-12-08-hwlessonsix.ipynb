    "1. Define **procedure** and **parameter** in your own words\n",
    "2. Paste a **screenshot** of completion of the quiz\n",
    "3. Define **Return Values** and **Output Parameters** in your own words\n",
    "4. Code a **procedure** that finds the square root of any given number. (make sure to call and return the function)\n",

    "### Topic 3.13 (3.B):\n",
    "1. Explain, in your own words, why abstracting away your program logic into separate, modular functions is effective\n",
    "2. Create a procedure that uses other sub-procedures (other functions) within it and explain why the abstraction was needed (conciseness, shared behavior, etc.)\n",
    "3. Add another layer of abstraction to the word counter program (HINT: create a function that can count the number of words starting with ANY character in a given string -- how can we leverage parameters for this?)\n",
