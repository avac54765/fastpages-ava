    "The logical operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. NOT: Not is a logical operator that reverses, or takes the opposite, of the data. For example, true would be false, and 1 would be 0.\n",
    "2. AND: decides if both conditions are met- usually an \"if\" statement and an action or decision will occur if both conditions are met. For example, if an animal is agressive AND hungry, then the animal will attack for food.\n",
    "3. OR: only one of two conditions needs to be met in order for OR to work. If one condition is met then an action or decision will occur. For example, if a person is old OR disabled, they may need a wheelchair. "
