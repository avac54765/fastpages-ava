My first algoritim fixes this issue with way <mark>fewer steps</mark> by having a loop that will allow a user to keep inputing tasks. This avoids duplication and is easier for a programmer to understand if they're are hundreds of tasks. In my second algorithim, a programer would have to keep adding individual task variables, inputs, and print them for every single task. This is very tedious if there are many tasks. My first algorithim only has nine lines of code with two or three steps, and can print unlimited number of tasks. My second algorithim requires two lines of code for every task, or two steps for every task. This means that the code would get very long if there are many tasks.\n",
